      question: "How does your white-label model work?",
      answer: (
        <>
          <p>
            Our white-label model seamlessly extends your internal origination
            capabilities while maintaining your brand integrity.
          </p>
          <p>
            We operate as an extension of your team, conducting all outreach,
            relationship-building, and engagement under your firm's brand, using
            your specific messaging and investment thesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            To business owners, we appear as part of your internal origination
            team, not a third-party intermediary. We are flexible on disclosure
            based on your preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ensure consistency in how we are positioned, but the core goal is
            always to build authentic, trust-based relationships on your behalf,
            positioning you as a strategic partner.

      question:
        "What makes your approach different from traditional M&A advisors or investment bankers? ",
      answer: (
        <>
          <p>
            The critical distinction is that we represent the buy-side, not the
            exit-side. Traditional M & A advisors represent exiting businesses
            and run auction processes focused on maximising sale price.
          </p>
          <p>
            We source proprietary opportunities for our clients (PE firms,
            Family Offices, Corporates) often before a business has decided to
            exit or engaged an advisor. This approach provides a first-mover
            advantage and the opportunity to build trust-based relationships,
            long before a business is brought to market - which research
            consistently shows leads to better valuations and superior long-term
            outcomes than auction processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our clients pay PhaseOne Partners to find and connect them with
            business owners in the niches and industries that they're focussed
            on, providing business owners with an on-ramp to capital partners
            who understand their business and industry, and can provide a
            flexible structure to suit their needs.

          <p>
            We have deep experience in sectors including Healthcare, Business
            Services, Technology, Education & Training, and Consumer, but our
            methodology is adaptable across industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            We typically focus on the lower-mid to mid-market space (businesses
            with $1-20 million in EBITDA), but our process scales based on your
            fund's strategy to include platform and bolt-on identification.

            Representing your thesis: This is paramount.
          </p>
          <p>
            We invest significant time understanding your specific investment
            criteria, strategic objectives, value creation playbook, and
            culture. We then translate this into authentic outreach, messaging,
            and screening criteria, acting as strategic extensions of your team

      question:
        "What's your fee structure, and how do we think about ROI on outsourced origination services?",
      answer: (
        <>
          <p>Our commercial model is designed for alignment and flexibility.</p>
          <p className="font-semibold">Fee structure options:</p>
          <p>
            Specific fees depend on the scope, complexity, and exclusivity of
            the work.
          </p>
          <p className="font-semibold">ROI consideration:</p>
          <p>
            PhaseOne Partners offers institutional-grade sourcing at a fraction
            of the cost of building an equivalent in-house team ($500k+ fixed
            annual cost).
          </p>
          <p>
            Sourcing just one proprietary deal per year that you wouldn't have
            otherwise found, or improving deal terms (proprietary deals
            typically close at 1-2 turns of EBITDA lower than auctions), creates
            value that vastly exceeds our fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            We establish clear KPIs to ensure objective evaluation of your ROI.
            PhaseOne Partners delivers disciplined, relationship-focused
            proprietary origination capabilities for PE firms, family offices,
            corporates, and private credit funds looking to enhance their deal
            sourcing without the fixed overhead of large internal teams.
